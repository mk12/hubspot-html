# Spotter

Spotter is a Chrome extension that allows you to upload HTML code to HubSpot articles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome.
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Choose the folder where you cloned Spotter.

## Usage

1. Visit a HubSpot article editing page (the URL should look like `https://app.hubspot.com/knowledge/####/edit/####`).
2. Type something in the article. One letter is fine. You just need to make it save something so the extension can replay the request.
3. Open DevTools by right-clicking and choosing "Inspect".
4. Click the Spotter extension icon in the toolbar (it should be orange, not gray).
5. Paste in your HTML and click update.
6. Click "Reload" in the "Reload site?" dialog box.
